/**
 This class creates a wormhole between a containing iOS application and an extension. The wormhole
 is meant to be used to pass data or commands back and forth between the two locations. The effect
 closely resembles interprocess communication between the app and the extension, though this is not
 really the case. The wormhole does have some disadvantages, including the fact that a contract must
 be determined in advance between the app and the extension that defines the interchange format.
 
 A good way to think of the wormhole is a collection of shared mailboxes. An identifier is
 essentially a unique mailbox you can send messages to. You know where a message will be delivered
 to because of the identifier you associate with it, but not necessarily when the message will be
 picked up by the recipient. If the app or extension are in the background, they may not receive the
 message immediately. By convention, sending messages should be done from one side to another, not
 necessarily from yourself to yourself. It's also a good practice to check the contents of your
 mailbox when your app or extension wakes up, in case any messages have been left there while you
 were away.
 
 Passing a message to the wormhole can be inferred as a data transfer package or as a command. In
 both cases, the passed message is written as a JSON object to a .json file named with the
 included identifier. As a data transfer, the contents of written .json file can be queried using
 the messageWithIdentifier: method. As a command, the simple existence of the message in the shared
 app group should be taken as proof of the command's invocation. The contents of the message then
 become parameters to be evaluated along with the command. Of course, to avoid confusion later, it
 may be best to clear the contents of the message after recognizing the command. The
 -clearMessageContentsForIdentifier: method is provided for this purpose.
 
 MMWormhole also supports passing NSCoding compliant objects as a fallback if you do not want to
 support JSON messages. Your root object for the message must conform to NSCoding and be fully
 archivable. That means that an NSArray's contents must also conform to NSCoding. The default for
 message passing is still JSON, and NSCoding will only be used if the passed message is not valid
 JSON. Note: as a best practice a message identifier should always be sent the same type of message.
 
 A good wormhole includes wormhole aliens who listen for message changes. This class supports 
 CFNotificationCenter Darwin Notifications, which act as a bridge between the containing app and the
 extension. When a message is passed with an identifier, a notification is fired to the Darwin 
 Notification Center with the given identifier. If you have indicated your interest in the message
 by using the -listenForMessageWithIdentifier:completion: method then your completion block will be
 called when this notification is received, and the contents of the message will be passed as a JSON
 object to the completion block.
 
 It's worth noting that as a best practice to avoid confusing issues or deadlock that messages
 should be passed one way only for a given identifier. The containing app should pass messages to
 one set of identifiers, which are only ever read or listened for by the extension, and vic versa.
 The extension should not then write messages back to the same identifier. Instead, the extension
 should use it's own set of identifiers to associate with it's messages back to the application.
 Passing messages to the same identifier from two locations should be done only at your own risk.

 @warning You should avoid situations where you need to pass messages to the same identifier in
 rapid succession. If a message's contents will be changing rapidly then consider modifying your
 workflow to write bulk changes without listening on the other side of the wormhole, and then add a
 listener for a "finished changing" message to let the other side know it's safe to read the 
 contents of your message.
